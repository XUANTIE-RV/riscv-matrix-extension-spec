The instructions in the matrix extension use 32-bit encoding and a new major opcode OP-M32 (1110111).

Instruction formats are listed below.

Configuration instructions, where the `imm` field supports 10-bit immediate operand.

Load & store instructions, where `ls` field indicates the type (load or store), and `tr` field indicates if the operand in register is transposed. `eew` field (000-011) indicates the effective element width.

Arithmetic and logic instructions, where `fp` field indicates if the operation is float point, `sa` field indicates if the result is saturated, and `sn` field indicates if the source operands are signed (for integer). `eew` field indicates the effective element width (000-011 for int8-int64, 111 for int4, and 100 to use `mtype.msew`).

Type-convert instructions, where `fd` field indicates if the destination elements are float point, and `sn` field indicates if the integer operand is signed. `eew` field indicates the effective element width (000-011 for int8-int64, 111 for int4, and 100 to use `mtype.msew`). `nw` field indicates if the destination elements are narrowed or widen.
